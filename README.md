# Third-Person Controller
Prototype of a third person controller for Unity game engine. It was made using Unity 2019.3.14f1.

## Features
- Running, crouching, sliding, rolling
    - The character sticks to the ground on slopes and leans while turning
- Jumping, double jump, wall jump
- Climbing ladders
- Hanging on ledges
    - Different animations depending on if the character can brace themselves with their legs
    - Supports curved edges and edges with changing height
- Wall running (no animations)

The controller still needs polishing especially when it comes to the animation.
